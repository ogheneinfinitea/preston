						<h3>PAST PERFORMANCE.   </h3>
						<p align="justify">Past performance is not indicative of future results, as returns may vary according to market conditions. Trading in foreign exchange is speculative and may involve the loss of entire principal; therefore, funds placed and used under forex signal services should be risk capital funds that if lost will not significantly affect one personal financial well being. No representation is being made that participating in forex signal services/subscriptions or managed forex trading program will necessarily lead to profit. Investors may incur into a series of consecutive losses and substantial equity-draw-downs that can deplete their funds before the occurrence of any meaningful profit.   </p>	
						<h3>  REGARDING PERFORMANCE. </h3>
						<p align="justify"> Hypothetical or simulated performance results have certain limitations. Unlike an actual performance record, simulated results do not represent actual trading. Also, since the trades have not been executed, the results may have under-or-over compensated for the impact, if any, of certain market factors, such as lack of liquidity. Simulated trading programs in general are also subject to the fact that they are designed with the benefit of hindsight. No representation is being made that any account will or is likely to achieve profit or losses similar to those shown.  </p>
